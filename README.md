# Serial-vs-Parallel-Computing
The main purpose for the project is to define the difference between serial computing or sequential computing and parallel computing. The main difference between serial and parallel processing in computer architecture is that serial processing performs a single task at a time while parallel processing performs multiple tasks at a time.
This project is Operation research project and this is semester project. I uploaded all the files but for directly use:
"You can run Single vs parallel computing file directly"
